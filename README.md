Data Analysis of Dataset related to Students Perception of AI in the field of Education. 


**We did data analysis on a open dataset which contained responses regarding a survey about how useful students find AI in the educational process. We cleaned the data, preprocessed and then did analysis on it. We did an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the dataset and visualized the results and our findings. Then we interpreted the findings into our digital poster.**
